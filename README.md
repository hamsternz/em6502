# em6502
A simple 6502 emulator - work in progress.

At the moment I'm working through enough of the Op Codes so that VIC20 ROMS work.

## Getting started

Run 'make' to build em6502 binary.

From http://www.zimmers.net/anonftp/pub/cbm/firmware/computers/vic20/index.html get:

* kernal.901486-07.bin2018-03-07 and save it as rom1.img
* basic.901486-01.bin and save it as rom2.img

The type ./em6502 to start emulating!
